    <h2>What I do at Setu</h2>
    <p>I'm part of the Design team. Ex-content and social media marketer who has since ventured into the exciting world of User Experience Design. Loving it so far!</p>

    <h2>Life Story</h2>
    <p><ul><li>Born in Mangalore and grew up in Hubli.</li>
        <li>After my schooling, I attempted competitive exams to get some practice and (hopefully) get admission into a good college for journalism. Somehow ended up with the 63rd rank at an all-India level in the hotel management entrance exam.</li>
        <li>Convinced I must have the aptitude for it, I joined the course. After a gruelling internship during Christmas (the busiest time of the year for the hospitality industry), I realised that it wasn't for me.</li>
        <li>Somehow managed to graduate with a decent grade :P Then came to Bangalore and with some luck, secured an internship at InMobi, where I got my first exposure to the tech industry.</li>
        <li>Decided to do my master's in communication and excelled at it. As a result, I was sent to France on an exchange program. It was my first time going abroad, and I loved it.</li>
        <li>Once I got back to India, I joined LBB Bangalore as a Content Associate. Met amazing people, got to try interesting experiences in the city, and dabbled in content writing and social media marketing.</li> 
        <li>A year after my stint at LBB, I joined the travel startup, Headout, as a Content Writer. Incidentally, the lockdown was declared in the very week that I joined. ðŸ¤“</li>
        <li>Two years later, I joined Mesh as a Content Marketer, only to discover that it wasnâ€™t my cup of tea.</li>
        <li>Started looking into UX Design courses online and did a bootcamp course by Google. Loved it.</li>
        <li>Reached out to Setu to see if they'd take me on as an intern so I could get some firsthand design experience. Best decision ever. Was converted into a full-time employee a few months down the line and am now working in the most fun team!</li></ul></p>

    <h2>A guide to working with Roshni</h2>
    <p>I have a super energetic baby at home, so I may have to mute myself or switch off my camera during calls. Please don't mind!</p>
