            <h1 class="contributions-title">Context</h1>
            <p class="nda">Setu had initially shipped a version of the PFM (Personal Finance Management) app that allowed all ICICI mobile app users in the country to consolidate their bank account statements and get insights on income and spends. For V2, ICICI Bank wanted to offer their users a consolidated view of their investment data (mutual funds, equities, and ETFs) as well.</p>
            <h1 class="contributions-title">Some of my contributions</h1>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>I collaborated with PMs, a senior designer, ICICI Bank stakeholders, and engineers to envision, design, and create the required UX flows for iFinance's investment offering. While seemingly simple, this was a deceptively hard problem, with many moving pieces and points of failure (FIP data delivery, infosec hurdles, and so on).</li>
                <li>Gathered contextual research on competitors to understand behaviors and patterns of investors in India.</li>
                <li>Explored different solutions through rapid brainstorming with a senior designer, and then proceeded to create user flows and high-level mocks that I delivered to my team. Some of these use cases include filtering for different investment types, showcasing the state in which a user's data fetching is in progress, and creating banners to indicate that new features are coming soon. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="nda">Due to an NDA, I am unable to disclose any further details about the project. Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:roshninyk@gmail.com" target="_blank"><span style="color:#A96DA3">roshninyk@gmail.com</span></a> to learn more.</p>
